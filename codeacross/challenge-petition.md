# Petitions

## What Is It?

* Make Government Responsive
* The White House petition site has transformed the way constituents are heard by their elected officials.
* Redeploy petitions technology for Hampton Roads.
* We the People is a new, easy way for Americans to make their voice heard in our government.
* If a petition gathers enough signatures, it will be reviewed by White House staff and receive an official response. We the People helps the White House understand the views of the American people and have a focused and civil conversation with them.
* Individuals can create and sign petitions that call for action by local government on a range of issues facing our region and cities.
