# Open Civic Data Scraper

### Contribute Scrapers to the Open Civic Data Project

The [Open Civic Data Project](http://opencivicdata.org/) aims to provide and promote common data formats and a freely usable API for legislative information.  Created by the same team that maintains [Open States](http://openstates.org/), the only freely available source of legislative information across all fifty states (including an [API](http://sunlightlabs.github.io/openstates-api/) and bulk downloads), the Open Civic Data Project is built to do the same thing for municipalities. We believe that turning representative information into first-class open data will enable civic innovations that help cities serve their citizens better and more equitably.

Help the project by writing Python scrapers that will bring information on legislators, legislation, and events into the system and the hands of other civic tech developers.
