# Open Data Policy

### Help Your City Adopt and Implement an Open Data Policy

In order to ensure that local governments are publishing data regularly and in a useful format, cities should adopt and implement an open data policy. If your city doesnâ€™t have an open data policy, work with your city partners to draft an outline for one or create an action plan for advocating for one. You can write a letter to your representatives explaining why your city should have an open data policy, create a slide deck to present at an upcoming city council meeting, or draft an op-ed for the local paper.

If your city already has an open data policy, suggest amendments for a stronger policy, help your city draft an implementation plan, or do an evaluation of the current implementation.
