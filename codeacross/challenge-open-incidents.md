### SafetyCheck & Crime Score API

SafetyCheck uses the city’s open data crime statistics to generate a crime score for your location. The app shows a CrimeScore from 1 to 10 of your current safety level and the number of recent crimes in your area. The app uses geofencing technology instead of GPS data in order to preserve battery life. Even if the app isn’t open, SafetyCheck can alert you via push notification if you enter a high crime area determined by a CrimeScore threshold that you set.
