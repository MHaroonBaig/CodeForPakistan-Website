# Open Data Inventory

### Do an Inventory: Where Does My City Stand on Open Data?

Contribute to the [US City Open Data Census](http://us-city.census.okfn.org/), which documents which major datasets city's have (and don't) and how "open" they are. These below links are a great 10,000ft view of how a city is doing with open data. We need your help to find information about all the datasets that are typical to a municipality, listed here:

 * [Portsmouth Open Data Census](http://us-city.census.okfn.org/place/portsmouthva)
 * [Norfolk Open Data Census](http://us-city.census.okfn.org/place/norfolk)
 * [Virginia Beach Open Data Census](http://us-city.census.okfn.org/place/vabeach)

The first step in making data actionable is to make sure the data is easily accessible. Many cities, whether they have an open data policy in place or not, have work to do in terms of making key datasets open and available in machine-readable formats. 
> Do an evaluation of where your city stands on releasing key datasets and work with your municipal partners to come up with a plan for making all of them open and available in 2014.

### FAQ

#### Q. Some of these datasets are complicated. Any background on them?

#### Q. Where can I find all the open datasets that exist for my city?
> One trick it to narrow google search to just your city website and just file types you are looking for, e.g. "filetype:xls site:vbgov.com" or "filetype:pdf site:norfolk.gov"

#### Q. I know of some open civic data, but I need a place to store it online?
> If you find data that is in a *machine readble* format, and it needs a home for others to download it or use an API to access it, we have two "Open Data Portals" you can store it in.

* [Socrata's Community Edition](https://communities.socrata.com/catalog/code-for-hampton-roads/) is easy to use and has point-and-click charting visualizations, but requires a special account to upload datasets. Email c4hrva-team@codeforamerica.org to get write access. Read access is allowed by all.
* Open Knowledge Foundation's CKAN http://data.codeforhamptonroads.org allows anyone to upload and use the data, and has basic visualizations and mapping support.

#### Q. How do I find datasets in general?

[OpenPrism](http://openprism.thomaslevine.com/) is a tool that aggregates many of the open data portals datasets out there, you can use it to compare your city’s datasets to other cities, as well as to see what data other cities provide that your city doesn’t.

In some cases, the city is not the entity responsible for a dataset (for example, in Tulsa there is an independent authority responsible for the transit system). That’s ok, we still want to know if and where those datasets are published. Be sure to note if it’s a non-city entity publishing the data.

If your city publishes all this data in machine-readable formats, give each other a round of high-fives! Then design/prototype an app or integration that would make this data useful for citizens.

### Next Steps

Once you have an inventory together, work with your city partners to figure out what barriers stand in the way of making any missing datasets public and discuss solutions to overcoming those barriers. Work with government to create a timeline tool and/or alerts for when data will be released. See New York City’s Open Data Dashboard and Philadelphia’s use of Trello for inspiration on creating a timeline.

If your city is making all this data available, now is the time to start thinking about what questions can be answered or problems addressed with these datasets. Take a look at what other cities are doing with key datasets. Are there lessons to be learned for your city?

To take this project a step further, you can pick an issue area of particular concern to your city (crime or blight, for example) and do an inventory of all datasets related to that issue. Then work with issue-area experts from the community to determine what potential value those datasets might have for addressing the problem, or what datasets are missing that would be particularly valuable.
